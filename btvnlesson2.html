		<td style="width: 70%; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px ">London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][10][11] Since the 19th century,[12] "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13] which largely makes up Greater London,[14] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.[note 2][15] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.

London, as one of the world's global cities,[16] exerts strong influence on its arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, health care, media, tourism and communications.[17] Its GDP (â‚¬801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest urban economy in Europe[18] and one of the major financial centres in the world. In 2019 it had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe after Paris[19] and the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe after Moscow.[20] With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[21] it includes Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[22] The city is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city in the world.[23] In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[24]

London's diverse cultures mean over 300 languages are spoken.[25] The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9 million,[5] made it Europe's third-most populous city.[26] It accounts for 13.4 per cent of the UK population.[27] Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe after Istanbul's and Moscow's, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.[note 3][4][30]</td>
